Will this work, I really don't know yet. I think so. :) I do not believe that there will be major changes
to either the Heatermeter or LinkMeter code base other than adding a couple new classes to communicate with
the DC Motor, Ether Card, and Analog Plugs. This could end quickly if the new libraries cause the app to run out 
of memory for programming. Parts list for the project are:<br/>
