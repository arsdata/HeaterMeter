Will this work, I really don't know yet. I think so. :) I do not believe that there will 
be major changes to either the Heatermeter or LinkMeter code base other than adding a 
couple new classes to communicate with the DC Motor, Ether Card, and Analog Plugs. This 
could end quickly if the new libraries cause the app to run out of memory for programming. 
Parts list for the project are:

1) JeeNode V6 NoRF variant - http://jeelabs.com/products/jeenode
2) Carrier Board w/Box - http://jeelabs.com/products/carrier-board">Carrier Board w/Box
3) Analog Plug - http://jeelabs.com/products/analog-plug
4) DC Motor Plug - http://jeelabs.com/products/dc-motor-plug
5) Ether Card - http://jeelabs.com/products/ether-card
